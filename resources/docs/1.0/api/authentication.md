## Overview
Imagefy API use API keys to authenticate request and attach it to a user. Every request is logged and can be 
viewed at any time by logging in to Imagefy dashboard

## How to get API Key?
You can generate a new API key by logging into Imagefy dashboard and navigating to API Settings then click on 
`Generate Key`. A new API key should be generated. Please note that there is no API configuration at the moment which
means that no security features such as "allowed origins" not available. Keep you API key safe.

## API Rate Limits
For security reasons we have enabled rate limits on some of Imagefy API endpoints. All rate limits are displayed wihin
API endpoint documentation. Please note that we do not increase rate limits on request.

## API Key block
We leave the right to disable any API Keys that we believe are being used to abuse system. Sharing or constantly 
hitting rate limits can result in account API access block or full account block. Please respect hard work.
