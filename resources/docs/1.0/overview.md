## What is Imagefy

Imagefy is a simple hosting platform for screenshots, images & gifs. The idea begind Imagefy is to allow users to 
take full control over how media content is shared. Imagefy allows you to share your media via unique URL or by generating
temporary URL that will expire after specified time.

## Can I join Imagefy?
At the time of writing this documentation Imagefy is still a closed project which means that users who want to join Imagefy
will need to request an invite to be sent to them. All invites are being manually reviewed. At this stage we cannot accept
too many people as it's still in active development and lacks important features that are being worked on

## Does Imagefy work with sharex?
Imagefy works with any screenshot tool that is capable of sending a ``POST`` request to our API with your image

## Are my images private?
We do not list any images for public to browse all uploaded images have unique URL generated once image is uploaded and 
can only be accessed via URL if your image is set to public. If your image is private then the only way you can share your
image is by generating a temporary URL to your image. All temporary URLs have an expiry time which means these will expire
after specified amount of time
